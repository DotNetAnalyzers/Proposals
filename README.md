Proposals
=========

A repository and issue tracker for proposed analyzers which have not yet been developed. Proposals should be treated similarly to requests; any user is free to start the implementation if they want to see a concrete diagnostic for the proposal.

At the point when a repository is created for a proposed diagnostic, the associated issue in this repository will be closed and future work will be performed through the issue tracker for the new project.
